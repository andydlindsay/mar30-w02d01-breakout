# Mock Exam Review

### Tips and Tricks
* Read the question thoroughly
* What data do you have access to? This is the input for the function
* What is the expected response/what am I supposed to do with the data? This is the return value
* Don't spend too long on a single question
* Use pseudo code to plan out your logic (comments)
* Rubber duck with yourself
* Write the minimum amount of code to make the tests pass
* Make the tests pass, then fix linting errors
* Google! Google! For syntax, how to calculate the middle index of an array
* Google Fu
* Submit frequently
* If you wonder "is there a problem with the tests?"... there's a problem with your code :)
